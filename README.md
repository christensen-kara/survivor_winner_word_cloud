# Survivor Winner Word Cloud
A word cloud of the most common words used in the final tribal speeches of Survivor winners

# Project Goals
The initial goal of this project is to create a word cloud of the most common words said in final tribal council by the winners of Survivor. In order to do this, I will:
1. Create a data set containing the season number, survivor name, transcript of what they said at final tribal, and whether they won or not
2. Clean the data and subset it to only look at winners
3. Use the Wordcloud Python library to generate the word cloud

# After This Project:
Where I will go after this project:
- Create a more in depth analysis of the differences between winners and losers in final tribal councile
- Create a machine learning model to predict if a speech will be a winner or a loser
- Program an AI to write a 'winning' Survivor final tribal speech
